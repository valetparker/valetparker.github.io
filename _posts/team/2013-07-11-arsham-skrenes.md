Arsham has over ten years of experience developing applications for both web and desktop use. He has developed systems managing the data and interactions of over 100,000 volunteers and staff members while at the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee. He continued his large scale systems development while working with PSI to develop its online University, helping develop a custom single-sign-on system between Moodle and Drupal. Arsham was also entered into the Computer Graphics hall of fame at UBC for his work on game engine development. Currently completing a masters degree in Computer Science, Arsham has a strong understanding of how to scale and build robust applications that perform well in low-bandwidth contexts. Arsham is one of the lead-developers in the Bivee group and ensures that applications perform consistently at scale.
