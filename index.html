				<h1>What does this app do?</h1>

			<div class="columns large-12 text">
				<p>ValetParker is the first mobile app that automatically locates you on a map and lets you pay when you leave the parking space. There are no parking space numbers or “codes” to enter into your phone. With ValetParker, you simply press the “Start Parking” button to begin a parking session. When you’re ready to leave, you press the “Stop Parking” button. The app automatically debits your pre-funded account and you’re charged only for the time you parked.</p>

				<p>ValetParker uses patent-pending technology to offer by far the easiest, safest, and most cost-effective parking solution on the market. Try it for yourself and see why ValetParker is quite simply the simplest parking app. And the most rewarding!</p>

						<h4>Download the app.</h4>
						<p>Currently the app is only available for iPhone but the Android app is coming soon. The apps are free.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Register.</h4>
						<p>To use ValetParker, we need some basic information, such as your name, address, type of car, license plate, and billing information. </p>
						<p>ValetParker will create for you an eWallet that you will load with funds (we suggest $25.00). When you leave the parking space, the parking fee is automatically debited from your account. When your balance falls below $5.00, your account is automatically replenished, making sure you always have parking money.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Login to the app.</h4>
						<p>After you’ve found the perfect parking space, login to the app. The app will use your phone’s GPS signal to “locate” you on a map. Make sure the location is correct and press the “Start Parking” button. Lock your car and be on your way—it’s that simple!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Start Parking!</h4>
						<p>When you’re ready to leave, press the “Stop Parking” button. The app terminates your parking session, debits your account, and gives you one minute to leave the parking space.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Redeem Deals Near You!</h4>
						<p>When you park with ValetParker, we may provide you with access to select Deals Near You from local merchants. When you register with ValetParker, choose the types of deals you want to receive. When you park with ValetParker, relevant local merchants can send you a coupon to redeem a Deal Near You using your ValetParker funds. If you like dining out and seeing movies, when you park near a local cinema, merchants near your parking space can send you a coupon for, say, 10% off dinner or a buy-one-get-one-free movie ticket. And the best part is that you can pay for these deals using the funds in your ValetParker account—there’s no need to bring cash!</p>

				<h1>Why should I use it?</h1>
				<p>We can think of a few reasons why you should use ValetParker</p>
			</header>
		</div>



		<div class="grid">
			<div class="columns large-12">
				<div class="text">
					<h2>Safety</h2>
					<p>Imagine that it’s dark and rainy when you park in a not-so-nice part of town. The closest parking meter you see is 100 feet away. Without ValetParker, you’d have to walk to the meter, enter your license plate number or parking space number, fumble around in your purse or pockets for money, then walk back to your car to place the paper receipt on your dash—all while you’re getting wet and could be exposed to potential pickpockets. With ValetParker, from the safety and comfort of your car, you simply open the app and press “Start Parking.”</p>

					<h2>Convenience</h2>
					<p>ValetParker is quite simply the simplest way to park. When you find a parking space, open the app and press the “Start Parking” button. There’s no need to remember your license plate number or the parking space number or guess how long you’re going to need the space. When you’re ready to leave, open the app and press “Stop Parking.” The app automatically debits your prefunded account the amount due and you’re on your way!</p>
	
					<h2>Deals Near You</h2>
					<p>When you park with ValetParker, we may provide you with access to select Deals Near You from local merchants. Here’s how it works: When you register with ValetParker, choose the types of “deals” you’re interested in receiving. When you park with ValetParker, relevant local merchants can send you a coupon to redeem a Deal Near You using your ValetParker funds.</p>
					<p>For example, if you like dining and movies, when you park near a local cinema, merchants near your parking space can send you a coupon for, say, 10% off dinner or a buy-one-get-one-free movie ticket. And the best part is that you can pay for these deals using the funds in your ValetParker account—there’s no need to bring cash!</p>
		
					<h2>Find Your Car</h2>
					<p>Ever forget where you parked? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. When you start a parking session, the app stores the location where you parked. If you can’t remember where you parked, open the app and press the “Find My Car” button. The map will appear and will guide you back to your car.</p>
	
					<h2>Pay Parking Tickets</h2>
					<p>We can’t promise that ValetParker will get you out of parking tickets, but you can pay tickets with the funds in your ValetParker account right from the app. If you get a ticket, two things will happen: your ValetParker account will show an outstanding ticket and you will be given the opportunity to pay the ticket using your ValetParker funds.</p>
