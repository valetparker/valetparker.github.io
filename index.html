				<p>We think parking should be intuitive, fast, and fair.</p> 
					</li>
					<li>
					
					<p>Your time is valuable and you shouldn't have to walk around until you find the parking code or space number, only to have to enter that into your phone. So we use your phone's GPS location to determine your parking fee. </p> 
					</li>
					<li>
					
					<p>We're no good at guesstimating how long it takes us to do anything, let alone how much time we'll need for parking. We don't like paying for parking and then being asked to pay again to add more time (and we really don't like paying extra transaction fees). When we're asked to add time, we start to wonder if we should just take our chances with parking enforcement. (OK, we admit that wasn't our smartest decision.) So we enabled payment when you're ready to leave the space. You pay only for the time you use. We think that's fair. We think you'll agree.</p> 
					</li>
					<li>
					
					<p>Simply open the app and press the “Start Parking” button to begin a parking session. When you’re ready to leave, press the “Stop Parking” button and we do the rest. The app automatically debits your secure pre-funded account and you’re charged only for the time you parked. Pretty awesome, right?</p>

						<h4>Download (it's free).</h4>
						<p>Right now, ValetParker is only available on the iPhone but the Android app is coming soon.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Register.</h4>
						<p>Registration is fast & easy! Tell us your personal, vehicle, and funding information and we'll set you up with a secure (and pretty nifty) eWallet that you'll load with funds (we suggest starting with $25). You can use these funds to pay for parking or redeem targeted deals (if saving money is your thing). When you end a parking session, the fee is automatically debited from your account. If your balance ever falls below $5, your account is automatically replenished so you never run out of parking money!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
	
						<h4>Start Parking!</h4>
						<p>Once you've found that perfect spot, open ValetParker--we'll use your phone’s GPS signal to “locate” you on a map and calculate the parking rate. Press the “Start Parking” button and go on your way—it’s that simple! If Parking Enforcement checks your car, we'll let them know that you're a ValetParker user and you'll pay when you leave. Say goodbye to parking tickets! When you’re ready to leave, press the “Stop Parking” button. ValetParker terminates your parking session, debits your account, and gives you one minute to leave the space.</p>

				<h1>Why should I use ValetParker?</h1>
				<p>We can think of a few reasons why you should use ValetParker:</p>
			</header>
		</div>

		<div class="grid">
			<div class="columns large-12">
				<div class="text">
					<h2>Convenience</h2>
					<p>ValetParker is quite simply the most intuitive and fastest way to park. Because your time is valuable.</p>
	
					<h2>Safety</h2>
					<p>Imagine that it’s dark and rainy when you park in a not-so-nice part of town. You see one pay station, but it's 100 feet away. Without ValetParker, you’d have to walk to the meter, enter your license plate number or parking space number, fumble around for money, then walk back to your car to place the paper receipt on your dash. All while you’re worried about your surroundings and you're getting wet. ValetParker lets you pay from the safety and comfort of your car. Now that's better, right?</p>

					<h2>We Let You Know When Spaces Open Up</h2>
					<p>When a ValetParker user ends their session as you're looking for parking, we let you know so you can take their spot. Because who likes driving around looking for a space?</p>

					<h2>Deals Near You</h2>
					<p>When you park with ValetParker, you can opt-in to receive access to Deals Near You from local merchants. Here’s how it works: When you register with ValetParker, choose the types of deals you’re interested in receiving. When you park with ValetParker, various hand-selected local merchants can compete for your business by offering you great deals that you can pay for inside the app using your ValetParker funds.</p>
					<p>If you like eating out, when you park near Restaurant Row, the restaurants can offer you a discounted meal that you can pay for by simply showing your phone. That's one way to impress a date, right?</p>
		
					<h2>Find Your Car</h2>
					<p>Ever forget where you parked? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. When you start a parking session, the app stores the location where you parked. If you can’t remember where you parked, open the app and press the “Find My Car” button. The map will appear and will guide you back to your car.</p>
	
					<h2>Pay Parking Tickets</h2>
					<p>We can’t promise that ValetParker will get you out of every parking ticket (We're not miracle workers here. You need to have a valid credit card on file, for starters), but in the unlikely event you do get a ticket, you can pay it with the funds in your ValetParker account right from the app. It makes parking tickets a little less painful, and we think that's a good thing. </p>
