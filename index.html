				<p>We think parking should be intuitive, fast, and fair.</p> 
					</li>
					<li>
					
					<p>Your time is valuable and you shouldn't have to walk around until you find the parking code or space number, only to have to enter that into your phone. So we use your phone's GPS location to determine your parking fee. </p> 
					</li>
					<li>
					
					<p>We're no good at guesstimating how long it takes us to do anything, let alone how much time we'll need for parking. We don't like paying for parking and then being asked to pay again to add more time (and we really don't like paying extra transaction fees). When we're asked to add time, we start to wonder if we should just take our chances with parking enforcement. (OK, we admit that wasn't our smartest decision.) So we enabled payment when you're ready to leave the space. You pay only for the time you use. We think that's fair. We think you'll agree.</p> 
					</li>
					<li>
					
					<p>Simply open the app and press the “Start Parking” button to begin a parking session. When you’re ready to leave, press the “Stop Parking” button and we do the rest. The app automatically debits your secure pre-funded account and you’re charged only for the time you parked. Pretty awesome, right?</p>

						<h4>Download (it's free!).</h4>
						<p>Right now, ValetParker is only available on the iPhone but the Android app is coming soon!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Register.</h4>
						<p>Registration is fast & easy! Tell us your personal, vehicle, and funding information and we'll set you up with a secure (and pretty nifty) eWallet that you'll load with funds (we suggest starting with $25). You can use these funds to pay for parking or redeem targeted deals (if saving money is your thing). When you end a parking session, the fee is automatically debited from your account. If your balance ever falls below $5, your account is automatically replenished so you never run out of parking money!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
	
						<h4>Start Parking!</h4>
						<p>Once you've found that perfect spot, open ValetParker--we'll use your phone’s GPS signal to “locate” you on a map and calculate the parking rate. Press the “Start Parking” button and go on your way—it’s that simple! If Parking Enforcement checks your car, we'll let them know that you're a ValetParker user and you'll pay when you leave. Say goodbye to parking tickets! When you’re ready to leave, press the “Stop Parking” button. ValetParker terminates your parking session, debits your account, and gives you one minute to leave the space.</p>

				<h1>Why should I use ValetParker?</h1>
				<p>We can think of a few reasons why you should use ValetParker</p>
			</header>
		</div>



		<div class="grid">
			<div class="columns large-12">
				<div class="text">
					<h2>Safety</h2>
					<p>Imagine that it’s dark and rainy when you park in a not-so-nice part of town. The closest parking meter you see is 100 feet away. Without ValetParker, you’d have to walk to the meter, enter your license plate number or parking space number, fumble around in your purse or pockets for money, then walk back to your car to place the paper receipt on your dash—all while you’re getting wet and could be exposed to potential pickpockets. With ValetParker, from the safety and comfort of your car, you simply open the app and press “Start Parking.”</p>

					<h2>Convenience</h2>
					<p>ValetParker is quite simply the simplest way to park. When you find a parking space, open the app and press the “Start Parking” button. There’s no need to remember your license plate number or the parking space number or guess how long you’re going to need the space. When you’re ready to leave, open the app and press “Stop Parking.” The app automatically debits your prefunded account the amount due and you’re on your way!</p>
	
					<h2>Deals Near You</h2>
					<p>When you park with ValetParker, we may provide you with access to select Deals Near You from local merchants. Here’s how it works: When you register with ValetParker, choose the types of “deals” you’re interested in receiving. When you park with ValetParker, relevant local merchants can send you a coupon to redeem a Deal Near You using your ValetParker funds.</p>
					<p>For example, if you like dining and movies, when you park near a local cinema, merchants near your parking space can send you a coupon for, say, 10% off dinner or a buy-one-get-one-free movie ticket. And the best part is that you can pay for these deals using the funds in your ValetParker account—there’s no need to bring cash!</p>
		
					<h2>Find Your Car</h2>
					<p>Ever forget where you parked? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. When you start a parking session, the app stores the location where you parked. If you can’t remember where you parked, open the app and press the “Find My Car” button. The map will appear and will guide you back to your car.</p>
	
					<h2>Pay Parking Tickets</h2>
					<p>We can’t promise that ValetParker will get you out of parking tickets, but you can pay tickets with the funds in your ValetParker account right from the app. If you get a ticket, two things will happen: your ValetParker account will show an outstanding ticket and you will be given the opportunity to pay the ticket using your ValetParker funds.</p>
